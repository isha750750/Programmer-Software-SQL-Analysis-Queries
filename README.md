# Programmer-Software-SQL-Analysis-Queries
This SQL project includes relational database design and query analysis on programmer, software, and study data. It covers table creation, data insertion, and solving 10 SQL queries involving joins, conditions, aggregates, date filtering, and pattern matching. Ideal for database learners and SQL interview preparation.

This SQL project contains a complete case study on managing programmers, software development, and studies with complex SQL queries. It demonstrates how to create relational tables, insert sample data, and solve 10 real-world analytical queries using SQL.

---

Project Overview:
This project focuses on:
- Designing relational databases
- Data insertion with realistic sample values
- Querying with:
  - Aggregate functions (`AVG()`)
  - Date-based filters (`MONTH()`, `DATEPART()`)
  - Joins (`INNER JOIN`)
  - Conditional operators (`<=`, `>`)
  - Pattern matching (`LIKE`)
  - DISTINCT clause for deduplication

---
 Tables Used:
1. **Programmer** â€” Stores programmer details like name, DOB, joining date, age, and languages known.
2. **Software** â€” Contains software details developed by programmers, including costs and selling prices.
3. **Studies** â€” Records programmers' enrolled courses and associated languages.

---

Key Features:
- Database creation with primary and foreign keys.
- Insertion of sample records for analysis.
- Complex queries including:
  - Average calculation by language.
  - Joining tables to fetch programmer-software relationships.
  - Filtering based on month and date.
  - Comparing development and selling costs.
  - Identifying programmers by language skills.

---

 Queries Solved:
1. Average selling cost of software developed in Pascal.
2. List of programmers with their ages.
3. Names of programmers who enrolled in 'DAP' course.
4. Names and DOBs of programmers born in November and December.
5. Software details developed by programmer 'Jane'.
6. Software where development cost is less than or equal to selling price.
7. Programmers who know C language.
8. Distinct course names studied by programmers.
9. Programmers who joined before January 9, 2020.
10. Programmers whose software sells for more than twice the development cost.

---

 Sample Technologies Used:
- SQL (Transact-SQL / MySQL Syntax)
- Aggregate Functions
- Conditional Filters
- Pattern Matching
- Date Functions
- Joins & Subqueries

---

 Benefits:
- Strong foundation in SQL querying.
- Mastering complex filters, joins, and data analysis tasks.
- Ideal for beginners and intermediate SQL learners preparing for interviews.
